          <p>The time I have spent in this class has been well worth the time. In it, I've learned many things, including the languages:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Java</li>

          <p> In the class, I was able to do many projects. While I have a link to my GitHub in the top menu, here I wanted to share some of my favorite projects that I have worked on in my time here:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Grimmello/thorins-travel-co">Thorin's Travel Co. (HTML)</a></li>
              <p> I liked this one because it allowed me to play with spacing and adjusting background images.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Grimmello/petpage">Pet Page project (HTML)</a></li>
              <p> I really enjoyed learning how to place images on a page. First day page, and I had a lot of fun.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Grimmello/alaska-vacation">Alaska Vacation (HTML)</a></li>
              <p> This one provided a lot of learning opportunity since I hadn't really worked with rows or collumns.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Grimmello/websiteRepoSetup">Repo Folder Setup script (bash)</a></li>
              <p> This one isn't an html page, but a script that my friend Mark Fisher taught me how to write. It automates a lot of the process involved with setting up folders for github, and has helped a lot in the learning process by making it faster to learn the actual material.</p>
