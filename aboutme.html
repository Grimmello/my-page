      <p class="panel"> &nbsp Growing up, I worked for my father at his construction Company. It wasn't always easy, but it taught me a lot about taking pride in my work. Your work reflects you as a worker and how much effort you're willing to put into something. Sometimes, things are out of your control. (ie. Bad materials, limited time, etc.), However, I learned how to pride myself in  my work.<br>
       &nbsp Now, I am on the learning track of Java and Javascript and it is one of the best decisions I have ever made. I love the flexability and how soothing it is. You slip into a rythm, and just keep going. Using my skills, I know I can build something that I can be proud of.<br>
      &nbsp Growing up in Oregon led me to a love of reading, of nature, and exploring the possibilities. My favorite series is <em>the Lord of the Rings</em> by J.R.R Tolkein.
